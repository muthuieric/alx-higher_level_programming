Python - Input/Output
In this project, I practiced file handling in Python. I used the builtin with, open, and read functions with the json module to read and write files and serialize and deserialize objects with JSON.

Function Prototypes ðŸ’¾
Prototypes for functions written in this project:

3-write_file.py	def write_file(filename="", text=""):

Tasks ðŸ“ƒ
0. Read file

0-read_file.py: Python function that prints the contents of a UTF8 text file to standard output.
1. Write to a file

1-write_file.py: Python function that writes a string to a UTF8 text file and returns the number of characters written.
2. Append to a file

2-append_write.py: Python function that appends a string to the end of a UTF8 text file and returns the number of characters appended.
3. To JSON string

3-to_json_string.py: Python function that returns the JSON string representation of an object.
4. From JSON string to Object

4-from_json_string.py: Python function that returns the Python object represented by a JSON string.
5. Save Object to a file

5-save_to_json_file.py: Python function that writes an object to a text file using JSON representation.
6. Create object from a JSON file

6-load_from_json_file.py: Python function that creates an object from a .json file.
7. Load, add, save

7-add_item.py: Python script that stores all command line arguments to a Python list saved in the file add_item.json.
8. Class to JSON

8-class_to_json.py: Python function that returns the dictionary description for simple Python data structures (lists, dictionaries, strings, integers and booleans).
9. Student to JSON

9-student.py: Python class Student that defines a student. Includes:
Public instance attributes first_name, last_name, and age.
Instantiation with first_name, last_name, and age: def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):.
Public method def to_json(self): that returns the dictionary representation of a Student instance.
10. Student to JSON with filter
